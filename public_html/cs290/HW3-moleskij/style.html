            <h3>Locations</h3>
            <p>There are 3 main locations where css style is located. The first is inline styling. 
                This is present in my h2 header on all pages, changing the font to a different font. 
                It is also present for my figure with book covers. I used the style there to allow the
                 book covers to be side by side. The second location where styles are often found is in the style
                tag in the head of the html document. I used this for my interests.html page to change the font 
                of captions and the color of the captions, as well as changing all p tags to be in small uppercase.
                The third place where style is located is in a designated css file, which for me is my main.css file.
                This is where the bulk of my styling is, such as my styling for the nav bar and the styling for the background
                of every page.</p>

            <h3>Selectors</h3>
            <p>There are different kinds of selectors you can use for css. The most common selector just uses the type of the element to change the styling of
                all elements of that type. Class selecters are used to select all elements with that class. In my website, I use class selectors to select all
                elements with a class of "definition" (in index.html) to then put a dashed border around the definition. Id selectors will select the element that
                exactly matches the given id. I used this to style my name at the top of the page, using the id of 'title' and then selecting it and making it bold with
                small caps. Attribute selectors are used to select any element with an attribute that matches a certain value. For example a[target="_blank"] would select
                all anchors with their target set to "_blank". I used this exact selector to style my Style page link to be italic. Lastly, there are pseudo selectors, such as
                :hover and :active. These select all elements based on changing information, such as whether my cursor is hovering over the element or whether the element is being
                clicked. I used :hover to change the border color of my images.

            <h3>Box Model</h3>
            <p>The box model is a model for how content is displayed in html. The outermost layer is the margin. This isn't affected by background color, and the border
                is inside of it. You can have a different margin on each of the 4 sides if you want. Next comes the border. This can be styled to fit how you want it to
                look. You can change the border to be different on every side/corner. Inside of the border, you have padding. Like margin, padding can be different on every side.
                Padding is affected by background color, and it is inside of the border. The innermost layer is the actual content. This would be like the actual text that you want
                to display. One example of where I use the box model is in the footer. I give a top margin to separate the footer from everything else. Then, I give it a unique border.
                Inside of the border, I have just some padding so that the border doesn't touch the text. Finally, inside of the margin, border, and padding, there is the content, which
                is some text in this case.

            <h3>Inheritance & Specificity</h3>
            <p>Inheritance means that when any element is given some styling, all decendants of that element can receive that styling if it is an attribute that can be
                inherited. For example, in my body styling, I set the font-size to 15px. This means that if there is ever any text within it, it will inherit that same
                size, unless it has a more specific size. This is where specificity comes into play. If that text has more specific styling, such as from a paragraph element,
                then that styling will override the body style. I override my paragraph text size to be 20px instead of the 15px specified by the body css.
