        Statement 1
        <br>
        <br>
        I am helping to build an inclusive space here at Oregon State through my work on the Human Powered Submarine team. I am part of a team in the club
        that focuses on steering, and it is an open place where anyone can join. No experience is needed at all, so anyone who is interested can take part.
        I am also helping through my work with the OSUMB. The Oregon State Marching Band is a no-cut marching band where anyone looking for a community
        can become a member. We are all there to support one another through both life and school struggles.

        Statement 2
        <br>
        <br>
        The engineering college is helping me become a person who will drive change in the future. They are teaching me the necessary skills so that
        I can impact the world in a positive and meaningful way. Through the coursework that I am doing, I am learning new computer science skills as
        well as personal skills that will help me.
