        Project 1: Book List Website <br>
        During the pandemic, I started to read a lot of books. So many, in fact, that I wanted a website where I could keep a record of all the books I read.
        This led to me creating my first website using Python as the backend and free hosting software as well as free database software. 
        Here is a link to the <a target="_blank" href="https://jakesbooks.vercel.app/sign-up">website</a> itself as well as the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CrazyheadJake/Book-List">GitHub</a>.
